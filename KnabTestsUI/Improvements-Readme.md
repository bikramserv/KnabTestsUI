# Improvements 


- Code can be cleaner.
- Twofactor auth tried to achieve but it could take more time so proceeded with normal login. 
  --Tried to use Microsoft.Graph; to read mail AzureAD and retrive the verfication code but lost some time.( But can be done and would be more secured)
- More validation on web components could have been added.
- Tried to make it more centralized by using more functions like one for Login to trello.
- More assertions and component validation could have been done as well.
- There is always scope of improvement.
